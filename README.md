# ph_preference
A project to develop a method for predicting the optimal growth pH of microorganisms from 'omics data.

# Repo layout
- R folder contains the code for the bootstrapping process used to calculate the optimal pH for a strain.
- Python folder contains code for matching reference genomes from short 16s sequences as well as ML code for prediction of optimal pH

# outline
1. We will identify some datasets with 16S (or other marker gene data)
2. Identify the pH where each ASVs is at its highest relative abundance
3. Match the ASVs to a GTDB (or other) genome
4. Annotate the genome with functions
5. Build a ML model that maps functions -> optimum pH
